# nodepi

This is an example of my solution for installing a standalone version of Node.js on a Raspberry Pi in support of a
larger project.

## The short version

I created a Debian package for my Node.js service, and wrote a post-install script that installed a standalone Node
version when the Debian package was installed.  I also included a systemd service file to run the service and to restart
it in case it crashes. This repository contains a sample of this technique.  Feel free to grab it and use it as a model
for your own Node.js services if you desire.

## The gory details

If you want a full explanation of what this sample contains, see my write up on
